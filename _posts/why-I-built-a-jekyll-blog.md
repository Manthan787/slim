title: "Why I built a Jekyll Blog on github pages and you should too!"

I started writing on my personal blog which is located at ['http://manthan.io'](http://manthan.io) and it costs about $10 a month, running a pre-installed ghost image on DigitalOcean.
It's not too bad. I like Ghost for a few reasons. But the most important ones include having a markdown editor and a clutter free user interface.
and this not-so-unique preference of mine stems from trying out a bunch of blog setups using wordpress. Playing with a wordpress installation, that's just not how you wanna spend your time.

So I moved to Ghost. It takes you write to the good parts, writing your blog. But it turns out, you can get pretty much all of that with Jekyll and Github pages. That too for free.
You just have to choose a good Jekyll them -  and there are many out there - or build your own and create a repository with <yourusername>.github.io. Not too bad.

I think you should get started too. It's file based, you get a nice version controlled blog without all the CMS crap and you're good to go. Try it out!
